# Anonymous Mood Board
## Project for CS50 2022

### Introduction
The aim for this project was to create a web application which logged user data regarding their emotions on a scale from 1 - 10 (with 1 being the lowest) and provide an anonymous comparison with all other users on the platform through the display of informative charts. It also provides a 'word cloud' generator which shows the user a generalization of all of the words they used to describe their choice. Users then get to decide what the scale means for themselves. The project draws upon concepts and tools learnt through Harvard's [CS50 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/project/).
